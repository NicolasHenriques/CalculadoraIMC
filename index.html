        <h3>What your BMI result means</h3>
        <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 
            'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy 
            weight may lower your chances of 
            experiencing health issues later on, such 
            as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a 
            nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar 
            content, incorporating ample fruits and 
            vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular 
            physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes 
            daily for five days a week.

        <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
        <p>Although BMI is often a practical indicator 
            of healthy weight, it is not suited for every 
            person. Specific groups should carefully 
            consider their BMI outcomes, and in 
            certain cases, the measurement may not 
            be beneficial to use.
        </p>

            <h3>Gender</h3>
            <p>The development and body fat 
                composition of girls and boys vary 
                with age. Consequently, a child's 
                age and gender are considered 
                when evaluating their BMI.

            <h3>Age</h3>
            <p>In aging individuals, increased body 
                fat and muscle loss may cause BMI 
                to underestimate body fat content

            <p>BMI may misclassify muscular 
                individuals as overweight or obese, 
                as it doesn't differentiate muscle 
                from fat.

            <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
            <p>Expectant mothers experience 
                weight gain due to their growing 
                baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-
                pregnancy BMI is advisable to 
                minimise health risks for both 
                mother and child.

            <p>Certain health concerns may affect 
                individuals of some Black and Asian 
                origins at lower BMIs than others. To 
                learn more, it is advised to discuss 
                this with your GP or practice nurse.
